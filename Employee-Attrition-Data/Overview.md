# Employee Attrition Data
This dataset includes employee attrition data from Kaggle.com and can be found at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/patelprashant/employee-attrition). The dataset contains 35 columns of employee data that includes variables like age, job satisfaction, distance from home, and most importantly, our variable of interest, attrition (whether the employee left or is still at the company). The dataset is pretty clean, but there were still some steps to take to prepare it for analysis.

This dataset was originally published by IBM, but has since been taken down. I acquired the datset from one of the mirrors on Kaggle.com.
